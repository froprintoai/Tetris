# Features
This version of tetris basically follows the rule from Tetris DS.
Super Rotation System is used to determine how each rotation affects the current mino's position. 

# How to play
python tetris.py

To play the mode of challenge AI, make sure there is a pit file in the same directory as tetris.py.
The default pit file, tetris-best_475.pit, is the model trained by tetris-gym/train.py.
